-- ============================================================
-- Migration 015: Link demo auth user to Demo Agency
-- The auth user eda1e373-1e5a-4689-bbda-188ea63ce7ae was
-- created for demo@email.com. The profile trigger auto-created
-- a blank "My Agency" for them. This migration:
--   1. Deletes the auto-created empty agency
--   2. Links the demo user's profile to the Demo Agency
--   3. Sets the demo user as the Demo Agency owner
